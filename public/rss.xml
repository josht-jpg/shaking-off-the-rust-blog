          <strong>Shaking off the Rust</strong>
        </em>
        is a series of exercises with the Rust programing language. The purpose
        of the series is to improve both my and my dear reader’s abilities with
        Rust by building things. Plus, by actually building stuff, we'll
        learn about an array of technological concepts in the process. In this
        installment, we’re going to implement a classic machine learning
        algorithm.</p> <div style="margin-top: 50px; font-style: italic;"> <strong><a href="https://www.sotr.blog/articles/knn/">Keep Reading</a>.</strong> </div> <br /> <br /></content:encoded>
